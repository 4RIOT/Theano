.. warning::
    If you want to install the bleeding-edge or development version of Theano
    from GitHub, please make sure you are reading `the latest version of this
    page <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano_versions/dev/install_windows.html>`_.

.. |PlatformCompiler| replace:: ``python-dev``, ``g++`` >= 4.2
.. |CompilerName| replace:: ``g++``

Install requirements and optional packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

    * Arguments between <...> are optional.
    * ``m2w64-toolchain`` package provides a fully-compatible version of GCC and is then highly recommended.

For Python 2*
:::::::::::::

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install numpy scipy mkl-service libpython <m2w64-toolchain> <nose> <nose-parameterized> <sphinx> <pydot-ng>

For Python 3*
:::::::::::::

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install numpy scipy mkl-service libpython <m2w64-toolchain> <nose> <nose-parameterized> <sphinx>

To install ``pydot`` (optional):

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pydot-ng

.. _gpu_windows:

Install and configure the GPU drivers (recommended)
---------------------------------------------------

.. warning::

    OpenCL support is still minimal for now.

Install CUDA drivers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow `this link <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads>`__
to install the CUDA driver and the CUDA Toolkit.

You must reboot the computer after the driver installation.

Installation of Theano and libgpuarray
======================================

Stable Installation
-------------------

With ``conda``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use conda, you can directly install both theano and pygpu. Libgpuarray
will be automatically installed as a dependency.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install theano pygpu

With ``pip``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you use pip, you have to install Theano and libgpuarray separately.

Instructions for other Python distributions (not recommended)
=============================================================

If you plan to use Theano with other Python distributions, these are generic guidelines to get
a working environment:

    * Look for the mandatory requirements in the package manager's repositories of your distribution. Many
      distributions come with ``pip`` package manager which use `PyPI repository <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`__.
      The required modules are Python (of course), NumPy, SciPy and a BLAS implementation (MKL or OpenBLAS).
      Use the versions recommended at the top of this documentation.
    * If the package manager provide a GCC compiler with the recommended version (see at top), install it. If not,
      you could use the build `TDM GCC <http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/>`_ which is provided for both 32- and 64-bit
      platforms. A few caveats to watch for during installation:

          1. Install to a directory without spaces (we have placed it in
             ``C:\SciSoft\TDM-GCC-64``)
          2. If you don't want to clutter your system PATH un-check ``add to
             path`` option.
          3. Enable OpenMP support by checking the option ``openmp support
             option``.

    * Install CUDA with the same instructions as above.
    * Install the latest, development version of libgpuarray following the
      `Step-by-step instructions <http://deeplearning.net/software/libgpuarray/installation.html#step-by-step-install>`__.
